##A program to solve this problem

2. The students attend the sports camp organized by the school. The teacher is required to select students for different games and roles. The students enter inside the room randomly. The teacher gets the details of the student which includes roll no, age, sex, height and weight. 
If the student is a male and has a height less 150 cm then he is selected for kho-kho team. 
If a student has a height more than 170 cm then he/she is selected for basket ball team irrespective of whether the student is a boy or girl.
If a student is a female and has a height between 160-170 cm she is selected for hand ball team.
If the students age is less than 12 then they are put into support team.
Calculate the BMI of the student if he/she is eligible to play the sports. Check whether the BMI score is upto the mark. If the BMI score is not upto the mark put the student in the fitness program for one month and then allow him/her to play.

The BMI score threshold for girls is 24.
The BMI score threshold for boys is 25.
